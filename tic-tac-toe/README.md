# React Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. It provides an interactive user interface where players can take turns marking their moves on a 3x3 grid. The game also indicates the winner or a draw condition when the game ends.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can click on the grid to make their moves, with the game updating in real-time.
- **Turn Indicator:** The game displays whose turn it is (X or O) to make a move.
- **Win Detection:** The game automatically detects when a player wins and highlights the winning combination.
- **Draw Detection:** If no player wins and all cells are filled, the game declares a draw.
- **Reset Option:** Players can reset the game at any time to start a new round.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the application.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing dynamic functionalities and interactivity.
